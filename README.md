# ID Classification and Verification

This project is a Python-based initiative aimed at streamlining and enhancing the verification process for identity documents like Aadhar, PAN cards, and Driving Licenses using machine learning.

## Features

- **Automatic ID Classification**: Uses machine learning algorithms to classify different types of IDs.
- **Verification Process**: Verifies Aadhar details with UIDAI's official database.
- **Web Interface**: Built using Python and React for robustness and user-friendliness.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, React
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Other Libraries**: NumPy, Scikit-learn

## Implementation

The implementation includes several Python scripts and a Flask application to handle the backend logic. Key files include:

- `classifier.py`: Contains the code for training the machine learning model.
- `main.py`: The main Flask application handling image uploads and verification requests.
- `aadhar.py`: Contains functions for generating and verifying Aadhar details.
